# TODO

So we'll want to set per-user / per-session UIDs. We'll start out here by just using random UUIDs. These are generated by the server and will want to be registered in some sort of state handler. We'll also want a function that checks the curent connected client count.

Then we'll want infrastructure on the server side that keeps track of which users are subscribed to which feeds.
