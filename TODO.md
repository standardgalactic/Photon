# TODO

So we'll want to set per-user / per-session UIDs. We'll start out here by just using random UUIDs. These are generated by the server and will want to be registered in some sort of state handler. We'll also want a function that checks the curent connected client count.

Then we'll want infrastructure on the server side that keeps track of which users are subscribed to which feeds.

Note from today:

So we can now create a message on the client that requests a subscription. The catch is: how do we track subscriptions on the server? We can create shared subscriptions easily, but can't create isolated subscriptions.

What that mean is: if we want to create a feed that everyone gets to see, that's fine.

But if we want to create a feed that only some users get to see, that's messy. Or if we want to create different versions of the same feed, that's messy too. Could use gensyms for this?
